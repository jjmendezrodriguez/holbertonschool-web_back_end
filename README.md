# JavaScript ES6

__JavaScript (JS)__ is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used in web development to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is a core technology of the web, alongside `HTML` and `CSS`, enabling developers to implement complex features such as real-time content updates, animated graphics, interactive forms, and more. JavaScript runs on the client's browser, making web applications fast and responsive. Additionally, it can be used on the server side with environments like `Node.js`, extending its capabilities beyond the browser.
